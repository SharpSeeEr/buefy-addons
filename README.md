# buefy-addons

A collection of additional components I have found useful that are built on top of [buefy](https://buefy.github.io/) and [bulma](https://bulma.io/).

Tests and documentation are WIP.  The main App.vue currently displays several examples of each component.

## Components

Clockpicker - a time picker utilizing a clock face, based off of the [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) [Time Picker](https://vuetifyjs.com/components/time-pickers).

Hold Button - a button that requires the user to press and hold to activate it.  The background color updates like a progress bar letting the user know when the activation will happen.

Hold Icon - like the Hold Button, but uses a single icon with a ring around it to show progress.
